 TCP/IP Model

What is TCP/IP Model?

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) is the practical model used for the Internet.

It is simpler than OSI, with 4 layers instead of 7.

Developed by DARPA to standardize communication over the Internet.


TCP/IP Model Layers

1. Application Layer



Combines OSI’s Application, Presentation, and Session layers.

Provides network services directly to applications.

Protocols: HTTP/HTTPS (web browsing), FTP (file transfer), SMTP/POP3 (email), DNS (domain name resolution).


2. Transport Layer



Ensures end-to-end communication between devices.

Responsibilities: segmentation of data, reliability (error checking, retransmission).

Protocols: TCP (reliable, connection-oriented), UDP (fast, connectionless).


3. Internet Layer



Handles logical addressing and routing across networks.

Responsible for delivering packets from source to destination.

Protocols: IP (IPv4/IPv6), ICMP (error messages and diagnostics), ARP (resolving IP to MAC addresses).


4. Network Access / Link Layer



Handles physical delivery of data over network media.

Includes OSI’s Data Link + Physical layers.

Devices: NICs, switches, hubs.

Protocols: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP.

Real-World Analogy Sending a letter via courier service:

Application Layer: Writing the letter.

Transport Layer: Choosing standard courier or express.

Internet Layer: Courier determines the route.

Network Access Layer: Truck or transport vehicle carries it physically.


Key Points

TCP/IP is used in real-world networks; OSI is a reference model.

TCP/IP is simpler and more practical than OSI.

Every internet communication follows TCP/IP model layers.
