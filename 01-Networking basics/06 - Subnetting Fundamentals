Subnetting Fundamentals

What is Subnetting?

Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, manageable subnetworks (subnets).

Helps in efficient IP address usage, reduces network congestion, and improves security.


Why Subnetting Matters

Large networks can become slow and difficult to manage.

Subnets allow better traffic control and isolation of network segments.

Essential for enterprise networks.


Subnet Mask

A subnet mask separates the network portion and host portion of an IP address.

Example:

IP: 192.168.1.10

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Network: 192.168.1.0

Host range: 192.168.1.1 – 192.168.1.254



CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

A modern method to represent subnet masks using a slash notation.

Example: 192.168.1.0/24

“/24” means 24 bits are for the network, remaining 8 bits for hosts.



Subnetting Steps (Basic Method)

1. Determine number of subnets required.


2. Determine number of hosts per subnet.


3. Calculate new subnet mask.


4. Assign network addresses and broadcast addresses.


5. Verify host ranges.



Real-World Analogy

Think of a large apartment building as a network.

Each floor is a subnet.

Each apartment (host) can communicate easily within the floor, but traffic between floors is controlled.


Key Points

Subnetting prevents IP wastage and improves network performance.

Learn to calculate subnets, host ranges, and broadcast addresses.

CIDR allows flexible subnetting, replacing rigid class-based addressing.
