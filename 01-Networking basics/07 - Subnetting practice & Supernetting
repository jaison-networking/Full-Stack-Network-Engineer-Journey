IP Subnetting Practice and Supernetting

1. Subnetting Basics

Review what subnetting is: dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable networks.

Understand the relationship between IP address, subnet mask, and number of hosts.



2. Subnetting Examples

Example 1:
IP: 192.168.1.0/24
Requirement: 4 subnets
→ Borrow 2 bits → New mask: /26
→ Each subnet has 64 addresses (62 usable).

Example 2:
IP: 10.0.0.0/16
Requirement: 200 subnets
→ Borrow 8 bits → New mask: /24
→ Each subnet has 256 addresses (254 usable).



3. Shortcut Tricks for Subnetting

Formula:
Number of subnets = 2^n (where n = borrowed bits).
Hosts per subnet = 2^h – 2 (where h = remaining host bits).

Use block size method: Subnet increment = 256 – subnet mask value.


Example:
Mask: 255.255.255.192 → Increment = 64 → Subnets: 0, 64, 128, 192.


4. Supernetting (Route Aggregation)

Opposite of subnetting. Combine multiple small networks into one larger network.

Example:
Networks: 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.2.0/24, 192.168.3.0/24
Supernet: 192.168.0.0/22



5. Hands-On Practice (Packet Tracer or Paper)

Design a network for a company with:
• HR – needs 50 hosts
• IT – needs 30 hosts
• Sales – needs 10 hosts

Allocate subnets efficiently.



6. Summary

Subnetting = divide networks.

Supernetting = combine networks.

Always calculate subnets based on host requirement.
