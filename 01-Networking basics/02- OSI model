OSI Model Layers 

---

What is the OSI Model?

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or networking system into 7 distinct layers.

Helps in interoperability between different products and software.

Created by ISO (International Organization for Standardization).

The 7 Layers of OSI Model

1. Physical Layer

Deals with physical connection of devices.

Includes cables, switches, NICs, connectors, voltages, and data rates.

Data unit: Bits (0s and 1s).

Example: Ethernet cable, fiber optic cable.



2. Data Link Layer

Responsible for node-to-node data transfer.

Handles error detection, correction, and framing.

Divided into two sublayers:

MAC (Media Access Control) – Controls how devices access the medium.

LLC (Logical Link Control) – Handles error checking and frame synchronization.


Data unit: Frame.

Example: Switch, Ethernet.



3. Network Layer

Responsible for logical addressing and routing.

Ensures data travels from source to destination across multiple networks.

Protocols: IP (IPv4/IPv6), ICMP.

Data unit: Packet.

Example: Router.



4. Transport Layer

Ensures end-to-end communication between devices.

Handles segmentation, reassembly, and flow control.

Protocols: TCP, UDP.

Data unit: Segment (TCP) / Datagram (UDP).



5. Session Layer

Manages sessions between applications.

Responsible for session establishment, maintenance, and termination.

Example: Session in a video call.



6. Presentation Layer

Translates data format so that the application layer can understand it.

Handles encryption, compression, encoding.

Example: SSL/TLS encryption.



7. Application Layer

Closest to the user.

Provides network services to applications.

Protocols: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.

Example: Web browsers, email clients.

Data Encapsulation and Decapsulation

Encapsulation: Wrapping data with protocol information as it moves down the OSI layers.

Decapsulation: Removing the added information as it moves up the OSI layers.

Key Points

Each layer provides services to the layer above it and uses the services of the layer below it.

OSI model helps developers and network engineers troubleshoot easily.
