IP Addressing Basics

What is an IP Address?

An IP Address (Internet Protocol Address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network.

Allows devices to communicate and send/receive data.


Types of IP Addresses

1. IPv4



32-bit address divided into 4 octets (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

Supports ~4.3 billion addresses.

Written in dotted decimal format.


2. IPv6



128-bit address (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

Supports a huge number of devices.

Designed to replace IPv4 due to address exhaustion.


IP Address Classes (IPv4)

Class A: 1.0.0.0 – 126.255.255.255 (Large networks)

Class B: 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255 (Medium networks)

Class C: 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255 (Small networks)

Class D: 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255 (Multicast)

Class E: 240.0.0.0 – 254.255.255.255 (Experimental)


Public vs Private IP Addresses

Public IP: Globally unique, used on the Internet.

Example: 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS)


Private IP: Used within private networks, not routable on the Internet.

Example ranges:

10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255

172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255

192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255




Subnet Mask

Defines the network and host portion of an IP address.

Example: 255.255.255.0 means first 3 octets are network, last octet is host.


Key Points

Every device must have a unique IP on its network.

IPv6 adoption is increasing due to IPv4 shortage.

Private IPs require NAT to communicate with the Internet.
