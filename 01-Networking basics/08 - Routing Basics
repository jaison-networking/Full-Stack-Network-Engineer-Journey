Routing Basics (Static & Dynamic)

Topics to Learn:

1. What is Routing?

Process of selecting the best path for data packets to travel from source to destination.

Routers make forwarding decisions based on routing tables.



2. Types of Routing:

Static Routing

Manually configured by network admin.

Example: Setting a fixed path for data to go from Router A → Router B → Router C.

Advantages: Simple, predictable.

Disadvantages: Not scalable, difficult in large networks.


Dynamic Routing

Routers automatically exchange information using routing protocols.

Example: OSPF, RIP, EIGRP, BGP.

Advantages: Adapts to network changes automatically.

Disadvantages: More complex, consumes bandwidth.




3. Routing Table:

Contains network destinations and next-hop information.

Built manually (static) or automatically (dynamic).




Real-World Example:

Static routing is like giving Google Maps a fixed route you must always follow, even if traffic changes.

Dynamic routing is like letting Google Maps auto-update and choose the fastest route based on traffic.
