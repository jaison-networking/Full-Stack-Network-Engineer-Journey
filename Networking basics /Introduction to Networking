# Day 1: Introduction to Networking & OSI Model

## üìå What is a Computer Network?
A **computer network** is a collection of two or more connected devices that share resources and exchange data using communication protocols.

### **Why do we need networks?**
- **Resource Sharing:** Printers, storage, internet.
- **Data Sharing:** Emails, files, media.
- **Scalability:** Easily add devices.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Shared infrastructure.

## üåê Types of Networks
| Network Type | Coverage Area      | Example |
|-------------|--------------------|---------|
|   LAN       | Local Area (Small) | Home, Office |
|   MAN       | City-wide          | Cable TV network |
|   WAN       | Country/Globe      | Internet |
|   PAN       | Personal Area      | Bluetooth |

## üîó Network Models
### 1. **Client-Server**
- Central server provides resources.
- Example: Banking application servers.

### 2. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**
- No central server, devices share equally.
- Example: Torrent file sharing.

## üìö OSI Model Overview
The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model standardizes how data moves across a network.  
It has **7 layers**, each with a specific function.

### Why OSI Model?
- Provides standard communication.
- Helps troubleshoot easily.
- Vendor-neutral reference model.

### üèó OSI Model Layers
|     Layer       |        Function         | Example Protocols |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| 7. Application  | User Interface          | HTTP, FTP, SMTP   |
| 6. Presentation | Data Formatting         | SSL, JPEG         |
| 5. Session      | Session Management      | NetBIOS           |
|4. Transport     | End-to-End Delivery     | TCP, UDP          |
| 3. Network      | Routing & IP Addressing | IP, ICMP          |
| 2. Data Link    | Framing & MAC Address   | Ethernet, PPP     |
| 1. Physical     | Hardware Transmission   | Cables, Hubs      |

## üîç Real-World Analogy
- **Application Layer:** Like writing a letter in English (user interacts).
- **Transport Layer:** Like choosing Courier vs Regular Post (speed/reliability).
- **Physical Layer:** The actual road on which the postal truck travels.
